# Multidimensional Signal Processing Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains all the materials for the Multidimensional Signal Processing course, including the final report and Jupyter notebooks. These resources are structured around three assignments, each focusing on different aspects of signal processing and analysis techniques.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Pelvis Mesh Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze pelvis mesh data to predict age and gender.
- **Description**: This assignment involves reading and processing pelvis mesh data, followed by various visualizations to check the data integrity. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other machine learning approaches are utilized to predict age and gender based on bone data.

### Assignment 2: Image Interpolation with Bernstein Polynomials
- **Objective**: Perform image deformation and interpolation using Bernstein polynomials.
- **Description**: The focus of this assignment is on using Bernstein polynomials to deform and interpolate one image over another based on specified landmarks. This technique allows for smooth interpolation process.

### Assignment 3: Pivot Calibration Using Algebra
- **Objective**: Use algebraic methods to perform pivot calibration for tracking three objects.
- **Description**: This assignment involves applying algebraic techniques to perform pivot calibration, a critical task in tracking three objects based on sensor information. The methodology provides a framework for accurate tracking.
